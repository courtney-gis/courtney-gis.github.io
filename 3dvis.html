        <h1>Introduction:</h1>
        <p class="indent">The purpose of this project was to create a 3D scene of the infrastructure on the Sable Island
            Natioanl Park Reserve. To begin, LiDAR data was downloaded from the <a target="_blank"
                href="https://nsgi.novascotia.ca/datalocator/elevation/">Province of Nova Scotiaâ€™s Data Locator -
                Elevation Explorer</a> and brought into ArcGIS Pro for processing. Then, the footprints of the
            structures
            were identified by filtering the LiDAR, and converting the data to polygons. The polygons were
            edited to match the structures as they appeared on <a target="_blank"
                href="https://geonova.novascotia.ca/110-000-orthophoto">GeoNOVA's 10k orthophoto</a>, which was
            used as a basemap. Next, elevation features had to be created, including a digital elevation model
            (DEM), a digital surface model (DSM), as well as a normalized raster. These elevation features were
            used to determine the height of structures on the Island. The structures and roofs were created
            and symbolized utilizing <a target="_blank"

                ArcGIS Online's 3D Basemaps Solution</a>. The data was then converted to multipatch, and the textures
            were downloaded from the free, open source, and copyright-free website <a target="_blank"
                href="https://texture.ninja/">Texture Ninja</a> and added to the scene.
