        <h1>Overview:</h1>
        <p class="indent">
            For this project, I designed and created a website with an embedded web map.
            The web map was developed to provide a line of sight analysis for 
            wireless internet service towers in the Clarence, NS region. 
            By using the ArcGIS API for JavaScript, I created a 3D scene that enabled site analysis and selection, 
            primarily through the inclusion and utilization of the 'LineOfSight' widget; 
            additional widgets were added to the map including the 'Daylight', 'BasemapToggle', and 'Home' 
            widgets. The 3D towers were symbolized via the Esri 'WebStyleSymbol', 
            and a community boundaries polygon layer was added and colour-coded, 
            and popups were designed to display specific community information such 
            as the community name and the municipal code. Overall, this web map provides an interactive 
            tool for site suitability analysis in Nova Scotia.
