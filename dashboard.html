        <h1>Introduction:</h1>
        <p class="indent">
            This project focused on using ArcGIS Online to analyze and visualize urban trail accessibility in Halifax,
            Nova Scotia. Urban trails can be defined as spaces within cities where people can enjoy nature.
            It’s important that urban trails are accessible to people of all abilities so everyone may experience
            nature without travelling to remote areas – a difficult endeavor for many due to time and financial
            constraints. Indeed, when designing urban trails, it’s imperative to remember that the
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/Accessibility-Guide-Book.pdf">“outdoors
                are for everyone”.</a>
        </p>
        <h1>Step 1 - Data Collection with ArcGIS Survey123:</h1>
        <p class="indent">
            To collect the data on urban trail accessibility in Halifax, an ArcGIS Survey123 form was created,
            allowing users to input data regarding their trail accessibility experiences.
            Questions for survey respondents were related to accessible features (washrooms, seating areas, signage,
            etc.), trail type (gravel, paved, etc.), trail difficulty (from easy to difficult), as well as the overall
            accessibility rating of the trail (accessible, moderately accessible, or inaccessible). The survey gave
            the user the option to enter comments and images, and also had a map for trail location (utilizing Esri’s
            OpenStreetMap), with the default location set to Halifax.
        </p>
        <h1>Step 2 - Data Display in an ArcGIS Online Web Map:</h1>
        <p class="indent">
            During the ArcGIS Survey123 form creation process, a feature layer was automatically created which was
            then opened and saved as a web map. A bookmark was saved to Halifax and the Esri Tile Layer World
            Topographic Map was selected as the basemap. The map was then symbolized by accessibility rating
            (accessible, moderately accessible, or inaccessible), and a strong drop shadow effect was used to
            enhance the trail markers. The pop-ups were then configured to show trail name, accessible features,
            trail type, difficulty, as well as any images and/or comments left by the survey respondents.
            Finally, the refresh rate was set to one minute, to ensure that all Survey123 submissions
            would be included on the web map in 60 second intervals.
        </p>
        <h1>Step 3 - Data Display via ArcGIS Online Dashboard:</h1>
        <p class="indent">
            The map was then shared as an ArcGIS Online Dashboard, and several features added including a map
            legend and an indicator to show how many trails have been added to the Dashboard. Additionally,
            three charts were designed to display trail difficulty, accessible trails, and trail type.
            A list of trails was also created to present the accessible features and any comments a user may
            have submitted; the list was configured with the map so that when either a trail is chosen from the
            list, or the user zooms into a trail, the data on the dashboard changes to reflect the trail data.
