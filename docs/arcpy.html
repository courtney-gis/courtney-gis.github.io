        <h1>Introduction:</h1>
        <p class="indent">
            For this project, I developed a Python script using Esri's ArcPy package to create a custom
            geoprocessing tool within ArcGIS Pro. To begin, two shapefiles containing data regarding
            the Halifax Regional Municipality were downloaded from the <a target="blank"
                href="https://catalogue-hrm.opendata.arcgis.com/">Halifax Open Data portal</a>;
            one shapefile was comprised of polygons outlining community boundaries, while the other
            shapefile contained point data of HRM-maintained washrooms. </p>
        <p class="indent">The goal of the script was to
            allow the user to select the washroom type as specified within the washrooms layer attribute
            table, and then enter a community name to view the number of selected washroom types
            (e.g. gender-neutral or gender-specific) in the desired community. This data would then
            be output to a table within the ArcGIS Pro workspace as well as an Excel spreadsheet in the
            .xls format.</p>
        <h1>How the Script Works:</h1>
        <p class="indent">
            The script begins by converting the two shapefiles downloaded from the <a target="blank"
                href="https://catalogue-hrm.opendata.arcgis.com/">Halifax Open Data portal</a>
            to geodatabase feature classes. This was completed via the arcpy.conversion.FeatureClassToGeodatabase()
            tool. The feature classes can then be queried by washroom type and community name by the user through
            the arcpy.GetParameterAsText() tool.</p>
        <p class="indent">
            For the washroom type feature class, a Value List Filter was
            created within ArcGIS Pro's Parameters pane. The options within the attribute table are listed for the
            user to select as a dropdown menu, including ‘UNIVERS’ (universal washroom type), ‘GENSPEC’
            (gender-specific washroom type), or ‘BOTH’. The script also asks the user to enter a community name
            after the washroom type via the arcpy.GetParameterAsText() tool. If the user enters in the community
            name in lowercase, the script converts it to uppercase as it appears in the attribute table for
            querying purposes. The specified washrooms by community type are then converted to separate
            feature classes displaying the query results.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">The number of specified washrooms within a specific
            community is then calculated by running the arcpy.SpatialJoin_analysis() tool on the queried feature
            classes. Next, the results of the spatial join are output to an ArcGIS Pro table utilizing a search
            cursor via the arcpy.da.SearchCursor(), arcpy.da.InsertCursor(), arcpy.CreateTable_management(),
            and arcpy.AddField_management() tools. Lastly, the data contained within the ArcGIS Pro table is then
            downloaded as an .xls file to the user's specified workspace.
        </p>
